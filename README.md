# fill_dir

This project started from me writing a MSDOS batch program, back in probably 1996 or 97. I was crazy enough to try recursion in batch programming. The program will recursively create directories/folders in a binary tree fashion to test the limits of the filesystem.

I am in the process of porting it to POSIX Unix.

The script is less than 20 lines, so I am not going to claim any copyright on it.
